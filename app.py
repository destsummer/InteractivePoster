        text="Suicide is a major national health concern. Current theories in mental health studies have failed to create predictive models that can be used in suicide prevention. Adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has led to a sharp increase in clinical data in forms of structured data, such as demographic information, medications, billing codes, etc, and unstructured data such as physician notes. Processing, formatting, and parsing of such notes are essential in helping produce clinical decisions. Preliminary work showed that our Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models are sensitive enough to pick up different topics related to determinants of suicide between genders. Currently, we’ve been working with doctors at the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and using a secondary natural language processing (NLP) tool called Clincal Event Recognizer (CLEVER). Our results have shown that important patient information found within the free text is missing from the structured data. Finding and supplementing this information will provide the VA doctors a better understanding of the patients at risk.",

Our methods and findings will generate results for VA decision making to help improve responsiveness.")
