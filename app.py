        text="Suicide is a major national health concern. Over the last twenty years, the suicide rate increased by 50% in the US. Among all groups, veterans have the worst suicide rate, almost twice as high as the general population, even after the normalization of age and gender. Current theories in mental health studies failed to create predictive models that can be used in suicide prevention. With the main barriers being the lack of publicly available data and the lack of sophisticated methods able to extract the socio-economic determinants from the large, complex and noisy data. Adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has led to a sharp increase in clinical data in forms of structured data, such as demographic information, diagnosis, medication, lab results, billing codes, etc, and unstructured data such as free format physician notes. These notes often include rich information that is not usually captured by structured data. Processing, formatting, and parsing of such notes are essential in devising machine learning algorithms to produce clinical decisions. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows us to find topics in such free format text notes. Can we create a LDA model that identifies topics related to the determinants of suicide? Working with doctors at the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we identified a group of patients with billing codes related to Diseases of Despair (DoD). This group represents an expansion to the suicide group to include drug abuse, alcoholism and other high-risk patients. We applied LDA to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) EHR data set and looked for topics in the notes. Our models are sensitive enough to pick up different topics between genders. Results of suicide attempt patient notes are also presented for comparison and validation.",

        text="Social determinants such as homelessness, hopelessness, and social isolation are important contributors to an elevated risk of suicide. Natural Language Processing (NLP) of the unstructured data has succeeded in producing insights in medical applications involving such concepts in addition to major diagnoses. However, action plans were not implemented. Our methods and findings will be incorporated into our work with the VA to generate results for decision making to help improve responsiveness.")

The weight of each word is calculated using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The LDA model is trained with BOW and TF-IDF. We inspected topics generated by the model and validated them by reading the actual notes. We trained the models with all available notes for the maximized information, and also with a specific section on the patientâ€™s history. Looking directly at the patient history allows for us to analyze the past, family and social histories of patients which tends to have more socio-economic information that we are interested in.")

The LDA model trained using the history notes identified that the suicide attempt group had histories involving alcoholism, hypertension, heart disease, cancer and more. To narrow this down even further, the history LDA model was trained again after separating male and female patients. Female suicide attempt patients had histories of hypertension, drug abuse, depression and more, whilst male suicide attempt patients had histories of coronary artery disease, alcohol abuse, cirrhosis and hopelessness.")

Using these topics and incorporating the top weighted words found in the notes, future implementation on the CDW of the VA can identify those who are at higher risk of suicide. Further development and refining is ongoing.")
